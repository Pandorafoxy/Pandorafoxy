        <h3> Artist's Statement</h3>
        <p>In this project, I was tasked with creating three self-portrait representing how I perceive myself spiritually, physically, and mentally. In order to create these images, I would utilize photoshop and manipulate photos to describe myself. During the descriptor phase of this project, I found myself struggling. I am used to taking how others perceive me and not so much how I view myself. However, with a bit of time, I was able to find words I felt described me. Now, when it came to finding the images, it took a while to find the right ones and especially ones that fit in with my composition. However, once successfully gathered, I felt my creation could really shine and as I focused in, I was able to create three pieces I felt accurately described me.</p>
