    <p>I was originally born in Florida where I spent my formative years. After that however, I moved to Texas and it was there, I found my love for art in highschool. It was there my teachers kindled that love and I soon found myself on the path to getting my Bachelor's of Fine Arts at UWF. Other things about me are that I love to draw. Wether that be digitally or Traditionally, it has been a constant hobby of mine.</p>
